My first steps with the D programming language. I will try to build a simple json rest service
, that i already have programmed with scala, with the D language.

First step build D with travis ci.
<b>Done</b> link to travis ci build https://travis-ci.org/pussinboots/dfirstweb
The build is now also green and use
    dub build
as defsult build command.

Second step run D with the heroku plattform.
